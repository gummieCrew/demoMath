data = [ 1, "F738588E-2062-463E-9B61-EF2FA039E56C", 1, 1339641727, "421151", 1339641727, "421151", "{\n}", "1-Jan", null, "1", "3760", "1199", "1", "1", "US Senator", null, "1", "(G) BREWER, Jim", "GRE", "C", "0", "0", "42" ];

	for (var x=0; x<data.length; x++) {
		
	
	}
	
	I was wondering if I could get some clarification of the titles belonging to the data. Some questions I have are:

Why are some precinct names dates? (i.e. Precinct_Name: 1-Jan,)

What do "Split_Name" and "precinct_splitId" refer to?

Is there anywhere where the terms for this data are explicitly defined?
